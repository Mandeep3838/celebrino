## Problem
Have you ever thought why we get too many emails regarding events/talks these days and any Solution on tackling it?

## Potential Solution
Let's make an App for our college which will manage all the events and notify you for favourite event!

## How ?
There are many ways by which one can implement it, but since our purpose for this summer is to learn something good
we will be using MEAN stack.

## What is MEAN ?
M - Mongo DB,   ( Database )
E - Express,    ( Framwork for app )
A - Angular JS, ( Frontend )
N - Node.js     ( Backend )

We wiil use this MEAN stack to implement our idea. 

Details regarding the MEAN stack is attached below. 
For now we have added resources only for those which we will require to start, other resources will be added as we go on further with the project :) 

## node.js

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network 
applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and 
efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices



## Angular JS
AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to application development. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application.
The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.


Enough of introduction, Let's start learning!
